<description>The Temperature Calculator is bugged!
Although the code is incomplete, there is already a problem.
Use "Code Tracing" to find it by reading the code line by line.</description>
<next-level>level1b.xml</next-level>
<failure_level>level1a.xml</failure_level>
<tech>To find the bug, just read through the code one line at a time and figure out which line of code is the wrong one. Fix that line with your Bug Fixer!</tech>
<hint1>This bug probably would lead to a problem when you wanted to calculate the average.</hint1>
<hint2>I wonder if one of the variables isnâ€™t initialized correctly?</hint2>
<timelimit>120</timelimit>
<introtext>It's time to find your first real bug.
Use CODE TRACING to find it!
</introtext>
<endtext>You found the first bug with CODE TRACING!
Congratulations!</endtext>
