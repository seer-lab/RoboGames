<description>The System File Number Ordering is not working correctly.
The InsertFile function has a bug that is affecting the system.
Use the &lt;color=#ffff00ff&gt;PRINTER&lt;/color&gt; to learn about the bug.
Figure out where the bug is, then use the BUGFIXER to catch it.</description>

<tech>If you want to find the bug, try using the PRINTER tool to look at the variable values during execution. If a number doesn’t match what you think it should be, that’s an important clue!</tech>
<hint1>Looks like the code tries to swap a file it shouldn’t be accessing.</hint1>
<hint2>Perhaps there is a mistake with the indices?</hint2>
<introtext>The System File Number Ordering is not working correctly.
Can you figure out what it's doing wrong?</introtext>
<endtext>The boundary bug has been caught!
Only one bug remains in the completed function.</endtext>
