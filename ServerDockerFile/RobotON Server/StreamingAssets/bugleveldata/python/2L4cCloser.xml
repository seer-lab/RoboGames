<description>Now you can use Code Tracing in the Closer function.
Use what you have learned from the breakpoints to identify the bug.
Use the BUGCATCHER when you have found the bug.</description>
<code language="python">class signal:
    def __init__(name,x,y):
		self.name = name
		self.x = x
		self.y = y

#Wireless Signal System Closeness Calculator
#Identifies the Closer of two signals based on coordinates
#Uses (X,Y) 2 dimensional coordinates and calculates the difference
#NOTE: Origin is located at (0,0)
#E.g. (50,25) is closer to the origin than (25,75)
def Closer(t1, t2):

    xdif $bug   xdif = t1.x - t2.x$= t1.x = t1.x = t2.x
    ydif = t1.y - t2.y
    if (xdif + ydif &lt; 0):
        return t1
    
    else if (xdif + ydif &gt;= 0):
        return t2
