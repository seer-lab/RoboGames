<description>The Wireless Signal System is malfunctioning.
It calculates the closest of two signals using coordinates.
Use Code Tracing to see how the Closer calculation works.
Use the BUGCATCHER to identify the bug.</description>

<introtext>The Closeness Calculator has a bug inside.
Use CODE TRACING to find the bug, but pay attention!
You will see this code again in the future!</introtext>
<endtext>You've found the first bug!
Don't forget how that function worked.</endtext>
