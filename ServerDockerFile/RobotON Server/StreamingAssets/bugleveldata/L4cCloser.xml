<description>Now you can use Code Tracing in the Closer function.
Use what you have learned from the breakpoints to identify the bug.
Use the BUGCATCHER when you have found the bug.</description>
<code language="c++">struct signal{
    string name[30];
    int x, y;
};

//Wireless Signal System Closeness Calculator
//Identifies the Closer of two signals based on coordinates
//Uses (X,Y) 2 dimensional coordinates and calculates the difference
//NOTE: Origin is located at (0,0)
//E.g. (50,25) is closer to the origin than (25,75)
signal Closer(signal t1, signal t2){

    int xdif $bug   int xdif = t1.x - t2.x$= t1.x = t2.x;
    int ydif = t1.y - t2.y;
    if (xdif + ydif &lt; 0){
        return t1;
    }
    else if (xdif + ydif &gt;= 0){
        return t2;
    }

}
