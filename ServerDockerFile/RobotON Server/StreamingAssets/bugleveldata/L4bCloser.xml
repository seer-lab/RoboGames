<description>Now is the time to use a breakpoint.
Set the &lt;color=#ff0000ff&gt;BREAKPOINT&lt;/color&gt; to check the state of the variables.
&lt;color=#ffff00ff&gt;ACTIVATE&lt;/color&gt; the &lt;color=#ff0000ff&gt;BREAKPOINT&lt;/color&gt; to observe behavior.
Use the BUGCATCHER to identify the bug.</description>
