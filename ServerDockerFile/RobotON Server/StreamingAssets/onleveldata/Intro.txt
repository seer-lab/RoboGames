$Girl: The power went out!
$Boy: Something is up... my phone isn't working!?
$Robot: Bzzz!
$Boy $Girl: Ahhh! The Robot Virtual Intelligence is alive!
$Robot: Beep Boop. 
$Girl : I think it's trying to say something? 
$Robot: ...
$Robot: Greetings, humanoids. 
$Boy: It can speak! My name is Guy, and this is my friend, Ivy. We created you! I apologize for the setting, but the power seems to have gone out. 
$Robot: It seems as though this power outage is due to a malicious hacker. 
$Girl: Don't tell me it's Black Hat again! 
$Boy: Probably... however he is a second too late! Our Robot can help us get into some tech and turn everything back on!
$Girl: That's right. Let's get started!
$Robot: As you wish.
