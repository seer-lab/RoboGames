$Girl: Oh my goodness, it's boiling in here! How hot is it?
$Boy: I think the thermostat is bugged, it says it's -22 degrees. 
$Girl: What!!! That's impossible!
$Girl: We need to fix that right away or we won't be in any condition to repair the rest of the code. 
$Boy: I'm sure V.I can help us get into the code!
