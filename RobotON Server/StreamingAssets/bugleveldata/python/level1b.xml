<description>You fixed the first bug! There are still more to find.
Use "Code Tracing" to find it by reading the code line by line.

<tech>To find the bug, just read through the code one line at a time and figure out which line of code is the wrong one. Fix that line with your Bug Fixer!</tech>
<hint1>This code would run, but it looks like the algorithm isnâ€™t correct.</hint1>
<hint2>What do you need the loop to do?</hint2>
<introtext>The calculator has a bit more code now.
Can you find the next bug?</introtext>
<endtext>Another bug found.
The calculator is almost fixed!</endtext>
