<introtext>Now it's time to use the &lt;color=#00ff00ff&gt;COMMENTER&lt;/color&gt; tool.
There are many colors to check in a short duration.
The &lt;color=#00ff00ff&gt;COMMENTER&lt;/color&gt; tool can speed things up.
Use it to Divide-and-Conquer!</introtext>
<endtext>That bug was tricky to find.
Well done!</endtext>
