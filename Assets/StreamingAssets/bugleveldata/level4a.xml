<description>The Wireless Signal System is malfunctioning.
It calculates the closest of two signals using coordinates.
Use Code Tracing to see how the Closer calculation works.

<introtext>The Closeness Calculator has a bug inside.
Use CODE TRACING to find the bug, but pay attention!
You will see this code again in the future!</introtext>
<endtext>You've found the first bug!
Don't forget how that function worked.</endtext>
